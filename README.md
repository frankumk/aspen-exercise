 - Improvements:
      - Figure out the 5k round tie...feature! No one wants to play war for that long.
      - break up play into different methods
      - less this, less ifs, more maps, more methods
      - less repeats
      - Add code to handle tiebreaker when player has <2 cards
        -Currently when one player has <2, player with most cards wins
